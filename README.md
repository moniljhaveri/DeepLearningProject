### Description:
This team project explores three different deep reinforcement learning methods: deep Q networks, policy gradient, and deep deterministic policy gradient.  Each learning algorithm was evaluated on various simulated tasks that included Atari games and robotic control simulations.

### Required Dependencies
Each of our algorithms uses OpenAI Gym to provide the simulated environments.  OpenAI gym can be installed at the link below.  A full install is required to use all of the environments.

### Run Instructions

#### DDPG:
Run python DDPG_Mountain_Car_Final.py.  This will run the basic continuous MountainCar-v0 environment.

#### DQN: 
Run dqn_breakout.ipynb. This will run Breakout. 

#### PG:
Run the jupyter notebook scripts in the policy gradient code folder, and the agent will automatically load the last check point, which is the final result of out trained agents.
